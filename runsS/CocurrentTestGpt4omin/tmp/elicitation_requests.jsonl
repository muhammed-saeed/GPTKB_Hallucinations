Given a subject entity, return as many factual (subject, predicate, object) triples as possible.

Rules: keep each triple atomic (one object per triple), concise, and factual; include at least one triple with predicate \"instanceOf\" when applicable; if you do not know the subject or it is not a named entity, return an empty list.
