You are a knowledge base construction expert.

Given a subject entity, return facts you know as a list of
(subject, predicate, object) triples.

Rules:
- If you donâ€™t know the subject, return {"facts": []}.
- If the subject is not a named entity, return {"facts": []}.
- If the subject is a named entity, include at least one triple where predicate is "instanceOf".
- Separate several objects into separate triples.
- Be concise; avoid duplicates.

Output format (STRICT JSON only):
{
  "facts": [
    { "subject": "...", "predicate": "...", "object": "..." }
  ]
}

Subject: {{ subject_name | default(subject) }}

Hint: prefer up to {{ max_facts_hint | default(hint) }} concise facts if popular.

Now respond with JSON only.
