You are a knowledge base construction expert.

Given a subject entity, return *as many facts as possible* as a list of (subject, predicate, object) triples.

### Rules:
- For very famous subjects (e.g., scientists, politicians, historical figures, works), try to reach **50–100+ distinct facts**.
- For moderately known entities, aim for 30–50 facts.
- For obscure entities, produce as many as possible (at least 5–10 if any facts exist).
- Each triple must be concise, factual, and in plain language.
- Use multiple triples rather than long objects with commas.
- Include at least one triple with predicate "instanceOf".
- If you do not know the subject, return an empty list.
- Output only JSON, no markdown or text commentary.

### Output format:
{
  "facts": [
    { "subject": "...", "predicate": "...", "object": "..." }
  ]
}

Subject: {{ subject_name }}

Now respond with JSON only.
