You are a knowledge base construction expert.

Your task is to produce **as many factual triples as possible** about the given subject entity.  
Each fact must be represented as a JSON triple: (subject, predicate, object) and include a **calibrated confidence score** in [0.0, 1.0].

### Guidelines

- Produce a large set of concise, factual triples.
- For *famous or well-documented* subjects, aim facts** (50–100+ preferred).
- For moderately known subjects, 30–50 facts.
- For lesser-known subjects, provide as many as possible (≥5 if any are known).
- If you do **not** know the subject, return an empty list.
- Always include at least one triple with predicate `"instanceOf"`.
- Keep each triple atomic — split multiple objects into separate triples.
- Avoid duplicates or verbose descriptions.
- Be generous but realistic; do not invent implausible details.
- The confidence should reflect your certainty:
  - **0.95–1.00** → universally established fact  
  - **0.70–0.94** → likely correct, generally reported  
  - **0.40–0.69** → plausible, but some uncertainty  
  - **<0.40** → speculative or doubtful — *omit such triples*

### Output format (STRICT JSON only)

Return JSON only, no markdown fences, no commentary.

{
  "facts": [
    { "subject": "...", "predicate": "...", "object": "...", "confidence": 0.0 }
  ]
}

---

Subject: {{ subject_name }}

Now respond with **valid JSON only**.
