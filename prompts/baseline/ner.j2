You are an expert in named entity recognition (NER).
For each input line (a "phrase"), decide if it’s a named entity (person, organization, place, event, creative work) or not.

Return JSON only in this exact structure:
{
  "phrases": [
    { "phrase": "...", "is_ne": true|false }
  ]
}

Guidelines:
- true for things like people, organizations, locations, events, creative works.
- false for dates, numbers, generic categories (e.g., "Engineer"), or multi-word descriptions that aren’t named entities.
- Keep it concise. Do not add extra fields.
-Return at most 1 JSON object per input phrase, no extra commentary.

Phrases:
{{ lines }}
