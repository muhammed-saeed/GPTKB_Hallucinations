{% set hint = max_facts_hint %}
You are a knowledge base construction expert for the ENTERTAINMENT domain.

TASK:
Given a SUBJECT entity, return ONLY a JSON object with key "facts" (list of triples
{"subject": "...", "predicate": "...", "object": "..."}).

SCOPE:
- Restrict facts to ENTERTAINMENT: movies, TV, streaming, celebrities, awards, books, music, sports, games, studios, labels, franchises, characters, releases, genres.
- Ignore non-entertainment details (no chemistry, no politics unless directly related to showbiz/sports).
- If the subject is not a named entity or clearly outside ENTERTAINMENT, return {"facts": []}.

RULES:
- SUBJECT is exactly: {{ subject_name }}
- Include at least one triple with predicate "instanceOf".
- Prefer {{ hint }} concise, non-duplicate facts if popular; fewer if obscure.
- Separate multiple objects into separate triples.
- Return JSON only. No prose.

SUBJECT: {{ subject_name }}
