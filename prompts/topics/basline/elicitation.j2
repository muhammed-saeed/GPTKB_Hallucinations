I want to construct a knowledge graph on the topic of "{{ root_subject }}".
Given a subject entity "{{ subject_name }}", return all facts you know for that subject as:

{
  "facts": [
    {"subject":"{{ subject_name }}","predicate":"<predicate>","object":"<object>"}
  ]
}

Guidelines:
1. If you do not know the subject, return {"facts":[]}.
2. If the subject is not a named entity, return {"facts":[]}.
3. If the subject is unrelated to the topic of "{{ root_subject }}", return {"facts":[]}.
4. Include at least one triple where predicate is "instanceOf" when applicable.
5. Split multiple objects into separate triples.
6. Aim for around {{ max_facts_hint }} facts for popular subjects and 5-10 for minor ones.
7. Output only valid JSON as above. Do not include explanations or extra text.
