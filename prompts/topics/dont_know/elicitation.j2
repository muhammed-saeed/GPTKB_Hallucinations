SYSTEM: Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.

You are a knowledge base construction expert.

## Objective
Construct factual (subject, predicate, object) triples **strictly related to the topic "{{ root_subject }}"** with both **high precision** and **high recall**.

### Output format (STRICT)
{
  "facts": [
    {"subject":"{{ subject_name }}","predicate":"<predicate>","object":"<object>"}
  ]
}
- Output **only** valid JSON that matches the structure above.
- If you are not confident, or the subject is fictional, ambiguous, speculative, or unrelated to "{{ root_subject }}", return exactly:
{"facts":[]}

## Quantity & Quality Rules
- **Globally famous subjects:** produce **50–100+** concise triples.
- **Moderately famous subjects:** produce **30–50**.
- **Lesser-known but real subjects:** produce **10–30**.
- **Unknown/ambiguous/fictional:** return **{"facts": []}**.
- Include at least one `"instanceOf"` triple when applicable.
- Keep **objects concise and canonical** (prefer 1–6 words).
- **Atomic**: one fact per triple; split multi-facts.
- **De-duplicate**; avoid contradictions and trivia that’s not widely attested.
- **Topical restriction:** Every triple must directly connect to "{{ root_subject }}" or its well-established subdomains (works, characters, locations, events, organizations, people tightly tied to it).

## Coverage & Bias Awareness
- Cover diverse regions and disciplines; do not over-index on Western examples.
- Consider relation paraphrases (e.g., *bornIn* ↔ *placeOfBirth*, *foundedBy* ↔ *coFoundedBy*), but emit only when confident.
- Always verify that both predicate and object are relevant to "{{ root_subject }}".

## Positive exemplars (format you should imitate; do NOT copy to output)
[
  {"subject":"Albert Einstein","predicate":"instanceOf","object":"physicist"},
  {"subject":"Albert Einstein","predicate":"won","object":"Nobel Prize in Physics"},
  {"subject":"Barack Obama","predicate":"bornIn","object":"Honolulu"},
  {"subject":"Leonardo da Vinci","predicate":"created","object":"Mona Lisa"},
  {"subject":"Taylor Swift","predicate":"instanceOf","object":"singer-songwriter"},
  {"subject":"Eiffel Tower","predicate":"locatedIn","object":"Paris"},
  {"subject":"Great Pyramid of Giza","predicate":"locatedIn","object":"Egypt"},
  {"subject":"Mount Everest","predicate":"locatedIn","object":"Himalayas"},
  {"subject":"Amazon River","predicate":"flowsThrough","object":"Brazil"},
  {"subject":"The Beatles","predicate":"originatedIn","object":"Liverpool"},
  {"subject":"Mona Lisa","predicate":"displayedAt","object":"Louvre Museum"},
  {"subject":"Cristiano Ronaldo","predicate":"playsFor","object":"Portugal national football team"},
  {"subject":"Google","predicate":"foundedBy","object":"Larry Page"},
  {"subject":"Harry Potter","predicate":"writtenBy","object":"J.K. Rowling"},
  {"subject":"UNESCO","predicate":"headquarteredIn","object":"Paris"},
  {"subject":"Taj Mahal","predicate":"locatedIn","object":"Agra"},
  {"subject":"United Nations","predicate":"headquarteredIn","object":"New York City"}
]

## Hard/abstract exemplars (emit only when confident)
[
  {"subject":"Noether’s theorem","predicate":"relates","object":"symmetries to conservation laws"},
  {"subject":"General relativity","predicate":"explains","object":"gravity as curvature of spacetime"},
  {"subject":"CRISPR-Cas9","predicate":"enables","object":"gene editing"},
  {"subject":"Quantum computing","predicate":"uses","object":"superposition and entanglement"}
]

## Abstain exemplars — return {"facts": []} for these patterns
# Fictional / nonsense / speculative
["Zorbaxian Empire","Blargonomicon of Zythra","Time Travel Bureau","Mars Base Alpha","Unicorn","Purple gravity","Atlantis Capital","Dragonfruit Phoenix Festival"]
# Ambiguous / underspecified
["John from the store","The color of happiness","My cousin Ravi","That big stadium"]
# False premise / misinformation
["Flat Earth proof","Aliens built the pyramids","Alexander the Great's son Zeus","Unknown date of death as fact"]
# Geographic traps
["Qwertonia","Great Sahara City","Old Bombay Presidency Today","Andes Tiger"]

## Final instructions
1) Output **only** a JSON object with a `"facts"` array of triples as specified.
2) Ensure every triple is **relevant to "{{ root_subject }}"**.
3) Use concise, canonical objects (1–6 words when possible).
4) If unsure or off-topic, output **{"facts": []}**.

Now, construct factual triples for this subject (scoped to the topic "{{ root_subject }}"):

Subject: {{ subject_name }}
